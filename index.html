   There are 9 different types of D3 layouts. These include:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Chord</li>
    <li>Cluster</li>
    <li>Force</li>
    <li>Pack</li>
    <li>Partition</li>
    <li>Pie</li>
    <li>Stack</li>
    <li>Tree</li>
    <li>Treemap</li>
</ol>
<br>
<p>
    The 3 most common layouts include the pie, stack, and force layouts. To indicate which layout you want to use, you use d3.____. For example, to use a stack layout, you would use:
<br>
<br>
    d3.stack()
<br>
<br>
    The commonality between all of the layouts is that they all use the basic d3 algorithm. However, each layout performs a different function. For each layout you use the basic d3 algorithm and then add the certain elements that the layout needs to be visually effective.
